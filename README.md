## Flask Crud App - Task Master
#### Following a tutorial by Jake Rieger at freecodecamp.org on YouTube
I already built a Flask web application on the CS50 IDE when I completed Problem Set 9 of the CS50 Harvard Course. And well, for the final project I wanted to transition to another IDE or code editor like VS Code. Turns out, it was a really rough start. I think my folders and all the files related to programming are sort of all over the place after years. So all the command lines etc didn't work at first like it is shown in all the tutorials. After a few days and with a bit of help on CS50 Discord I could resolve the problems. I could finally actually begin to code! Instead of dealing with technical details of making the code editor work. So yeah, I'm slowly starting to get used to working in the new environment.
After this short refresher of a web application, let's get on to building something bigger. The Final Project of CS50 is waiting.
